        // Menu-bar items + keyboard shortcuts. Only meaningful on Mac (via "Designed for
        // iPad on Mac" — Catalyst would also pick them up if we ever enable it), but
        // harmless to register everywhere — iPhone shows no menu bar, iPad-with-keyboard
        // picks up the shortcuts which is a fine bonus. See `MacCommands`.
